# This will examine the parameters passed, and will attempt to reboot
# the list of servers, in the order provided, optionally stopping
# services, optionally disabling tasks
#
#  On all servers:  the order of executions is:
#
#  The general rule is:
#   1.	in REVERSE ORDER of the servers;
#       a.	disable any tasks
#       b.	stop any services
#   2.	In SERVER ORDER:
#       a.	REBOOT and wait for the server reboot to complete
#            optionally - run a JAMS job waiting for it to complete
#            optionally - wait for a service to reach a desired state
#       b.	when the server is back up;
#           i.	start the service(s) associated with this  server if needed
#           ii.	enable the task(s) associated with this server
#
# format that is expected for each line of the parameters passed is:

$VER="2.0"
# 1/26/2015 hsamm  - added logic on reboot, to wait until the 'systeminfo' command comes back with the
#                   string " Time:" before it assumes that windows is up and functional.

#  SERVERNAME|servicename1,servicename2,service3,...|taskname1,taskname2,...:service=name=state
#                  or
#  sleepnnn::   - a number of seconds to sleep before proceeding
#                  or
#  job::UNC_jobname   -  name of a job to run and wait for completion before proceeding
#                  
#  
#
#
$VER="2.1"  # 2/3/2015 - hsamm - made it so that servers entered in the parameter list are entered in 
#                                order that the reboots are to occur.
$VER="2.2"  # 2/4/2015 - hsamm - placed in a pre-check list to insure that we're at least able to communicate
#                                with the server.  also on a trial run, don't end, just continue on, but not
#                                potential problems for diagnostic purposes.
$VER="3.0"  # 2/4/2015 - hsamm - logic to handle a 4th parameter - format is:
#                                  service=servicename=running
#                                what this will do is once server has come back up from a reboot, the
#                                reboot process will wait until the service referenced by name is in the
#                                state.  useful in cases where a DB server has been rebooted and a wait is 
#                                needed until the SQL agent is running.
#
$VER="3.1"  # 2/6/2015 - hsamm - added a query for the field service=name=state for the trial balance
#                                just showing what the current state the service is in.
#
$VER="3.2"  # 2/9/2015 - hsamm - added logic to allow multiple service=name=state
#
$VER="4.0"  # 2/10/2015 - hsamm - add logic for ASYNC reboots of servers - with servers marked as
#                                 ASYNC, a separate JAMS job will be started.  A variable will be
#                                 set in 00_SAMC_GLOBAL_VARIABLES with the name REB00T_nnnn where
#                                 nnnn is the JAMS entry number.  the "child" job will read that
#                                 variable, which will be nothing more than the name of the server
#                                 that needs to be rebooted, and it will do nothing more than perform
#                                 ONLY the same REBOOT section of this job, without any contingencies.
